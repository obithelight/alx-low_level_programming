# 0x14. C - Bit manipulation

Manipulating bits and using bitwise operators is fundamental in computer programming, mainly when dealing with low-level operations and optimizations. Bitwise operators allow you to perform functions at the individual bit level within integer values.

## Learning Objectives
- How to manipulate bits and use bitwise operators

### Basic Bitwise Operators:

- AND (&): Performs a bitwise AND operation on each pair of corresponding bits in two integers. The result is 1 only if both bits are 1.

- OR (|): Performs a bitwise OR operation on each pair of corresponding bits in two integers. The result is 1 if at least one of the bits is 1.

- XOR (^): Performs a bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) operation on each pair of corresponding bits in two integers. The result is 1 if the bits are different.

- NOT (~): Performs a bitwise NOT operation, which flips the bits, changing 0s to 1s and 1s to 0s.

- Left Shift (<<): Shifts the bits of an integer to the left by a specified number of positions. This is equivalent to multiplying the integer by 2 raised to the power of the shift amount.

- Right Shift (>>): Shifts the bits of an integer to the right by a specified number of positions. This is equivalent to dividing the integer by 2 raised to the power of the shift amount.
