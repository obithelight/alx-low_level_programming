## What is a doubly linked list?
- A doubly linked list is a type of linked list in which each node contains a data element and two pointers, one pointing to the next node in the sequence (next pointer) and another pointing to the previous node (previous pointer). This allows for traversal in both directionsâ€”forward and backward.
