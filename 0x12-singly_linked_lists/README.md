# 0x12. C - Singly linked lists

##  Data structures and Algorithm

- Linked lists are data structures where elements, called nodes, are connected using pointers or references. Each node contains the actual data and a reference (pointer) to the next node in the list. Linked lists have a dynamic structure, meaning they can grow or shrink easily during runtime, unlike arrays, which have a fixed size.
