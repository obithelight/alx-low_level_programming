- Linked lists are data structures where elements, called nodes, are connected using pointers or references. Each node contains the actual data and a reference (pointer) to the next node in the list. Linked lists have a dynamic structure, meaning they can grow or shrink quickly during runtime, unlike arrays with a fixed size.
